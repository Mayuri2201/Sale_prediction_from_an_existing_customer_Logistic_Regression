The xSale Prediction from an Existing Customer project utilizes Logistic Regression to forecast the likelihood of a customer making a future purchase based on historical data. This predictive model analyzes key customer attributes, such as past purchase behavior, engagement metrics, and demographic details, to classify whether a customer is likely to buy again. By leveraging Logistic Regression, a widely used classification algorithm, the project aims to enhance sales strategies, improve customer retention, and optimize marketing efforts by identifying high-potential customers. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable predictions.
